Investing in luxury could be more environmentally friendly than investing in Tesla?

More than 1,200 ESG funds now hold shares of LVMH, the world's biggest producer of luxury goods.

On the social side, when it comes to pay, LVMH are committed to gender equity.

And, unlike so-called fast fashion producers, luxury firms tend to produce smaller batches than the mass market, â€œso the environmental impact is smaller, plus the goods are aimed to last.

Would you consider investing in LVMH to up your ESG game? Or do you agree luxury goods actually highlight social inequality. Shape the conversation on Backchannel.
